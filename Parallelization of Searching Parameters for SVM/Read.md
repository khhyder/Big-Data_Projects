Model regularization parameters in Support vector machines (SVM) play a vital role on models’ efficiency as well as to boost up the models’ predictive power. SVM has low tendency to over-fit which allows a better choice of free parameters. Tuning of parameters has been offered through many packages depending on various programing language platforms. Many of those packages offers sequential execution of tuning which led a time inefficient scenario. In this work, parallel execution of searching parameters has been examined and performance comparisons have been made with multiple core along with multiple data folds. Our result shows that higher number of processing cores performs better when data split increased to a certain level.
