This foldar contains the implementation of document locator using Apache Spark 2.2.
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. 
Apache Spark currently supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Scala, R and Python. 
In this project I have used Python. I have also used Jupyter notebook application which require python 3. 
Since the begining I was using python 2, to run pyspark I have created virtual environment(https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
